# Vehicle Detection
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)


In this project, your goal is to write a software pipeline to detect vehicles in a video (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4), but the main output or product we want you to create is a detailed writeup of the project.  

Please refer to the writeups for
* [model creation and learning](P5_model.pdf)
* [Image pipeline and video generation](P5_vehicle-detection.pdf)

Results of final project video can be seen [HERE](project_video_with_vehicles_detected.mp4)
